            <DIV style="padding-left:20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Esquimalt Graving Dock (EGD) Online Booking System provides a quick and convenient way to reserve space online for any of the EGD facilities, including the drydock and jetties. The system also allows users to monitor the status of drydock and jetty bookings along with providing access to all required forms. Automatic email notifications are used to alert users of any changes to their accounts or bookings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An administrator has control over all functionality of the system. Administrators have the ability to add, edit and delete any users, companies or vessels in the system. The booking system gives administrators the ability to make any bookings they wish, short of booking vessels that will not fit into the drydock or booking the same vessel to be in two places at once. The administrators are also expected to monitor company and user account requests, and approve or reject them.</DIV>

This brings you to the booking login page; here, click on &quot;Add new user account.&quot;              Now user details can be entered, including: first name, last name, 6-10 character password and email address, all of which are required.  The email address provided will be used for logging in and receiving email notifications from EGD administrators.  Your password is not case-sensitive, so using uppercase letters is not any different from using lowercase.  It is recommended that you make your password more robust by using a combination of letters and numbers.              <br />

If the company that you represent is not listed, see 2.2.4. Being associated with a company is required for logging in to the system. As an administrator you will likely only need to be associated with the administrating company (EGD). If you are unsure of which company to add yourself to, contact the current EGD administration using the &quot;Contact Us&quot; link in the side menu bar (Figure 1).<br />

You also have the option of navigating throughout the site at any time using the breadcrumbs displayed between the EGD banner and the page title (Figure 4).

You can approve a user-company relationship either by clicking on the link within that sentence, or by clicking on the &quot;Approve&quot; button under the &quot;Users&quot; heading.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;User Approval&quot; page lists the requests by company, with each user awaiting approval to represent that company underneath the company heading. The company heading is a link, which links to a pop-up displaying the company details. If a user listing does not have an &quot;Approve&quot; button next to it, then the company is still pending approval and must be approved first. Regardless of whether you approve or reject a user company request, the user will receive email notification of the status of their request.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon rejection of of a company, if the user is not attached to any other company relationships, the user account will be deleted. Doing so will allow the user to input a request at a later date.

<DIV style="padding-left:60px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will be alerted of pending company approvals at the top of the &quot;Administrative Functions&quot; page just below the user-company approvals alert (Figure 5). There is a line that states how many company requests need to be approved. You can approve a company either by clicking on the link within that sentence, or by clicking on the &quot;Approve&quot; button under the &quot;Companies&quot; heading.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to approve a company, you must first enter the company abbreviation into the text field labeled &quot;Abbrev.&quot; This abbreviation must be unique to the system as the abbreviation is used to display a vessel's company in the bookings summary. If you choose to reject the company, it will be deleted from the system and all users that were pending approval to represent the company will receive email notification of the company rejection.</DIV>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recommended that you make passwords more robust by using a combination of letters and numbers. Frequently changing your own password will also increase the security of your account.
