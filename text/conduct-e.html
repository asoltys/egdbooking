            <p align="center"><strong>ARTICLE 1 </strong></p>
            <p align="center"><strong>OBJECT AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES</strong></p>
            <p><strong>1.1 Object of Code</strong>. <em> Conducting business
                at the Esquimalt Graving Dock is a privilege, not a right.</em> The
                object of this Code is to establish and articulate the corporate
                values, responsibilities, obligations and ethical policies that
                all businesses, as applicable, are to prescribe to <em>while
                operating at the Esquimalt Graving Dock</em>. </p>
            <p>As a multi-user, open facility owned by the people of Canada,
              we value transparency and openness. It is expected that the users
              of this facility respect the Esquimalt Graving Dock&rsquo;s established
              processes and systems and will not use these processes and systems
              to the detriment of another user. It is also expected that the
              behavior of the businesses using this facility reflects the expectations
              of the Canadian taxpayer. The values that are important in the
              conduct of business at this facility include integrity, responsibility
              and reputation. These values are the minimum standards that are
              to be adhered to.</p>
            <p>Public Works and Government Services Canada is committed to ensuring
              strong workplace ethics. In support of the department&rsquo;s own
              ethical blueprint, it is expected that: users conduct themselves
              with integrity and treat others with respect; act in the best interest
              of the public; and respect the commitments of this federal government
              facility. </p>
            <p><strong>1.2 Guiding Principles</strong>. All businesses operating
              at the Esquimalt Graving Dock are to abide by the following principles:</p>
            <p>(a) The Government of Canada operates the Esquimalt Graving Dock
              as an open, public facility, providing service on a first-come,
              first-served basis. Engaging in behavior contrary to its use as
              a unique public facility does not allow for a healthy and competitive
              marketplace on the West Coast;</p>
            <p>(b) The Government of Canada commits to its environmental responsibilities
              under ISO 14001 certification;</p>
            <p>(c) As a designated port, the Government of Canada will adhere
              to the commitments required for international security as determined
              by the International Ship and Port Security (ISPS) legislation. </p>
            <p>(d) Businesses have a responsibility to maintain an environment
              where conflict and difference can be addressed in a manner characterized
              by respect and civility;</p>
            <p>(e) All businesses are to accept responsibility for their actions
              and activities; and</p>
            <p>(f) Ethical behavior and goodwill demonstrated by all businesses
            is expected.            </p>
            <p><strong>1.3 Application of Code</strong>. This Code applies to
            all users conducting business at the Esquimalt Graving Dock.<strong></strong></p>
            <p><strong>1.4 Scope of Obligations</strong>. Complying to the specific
              requirements of this Code will not absolve a director or officer
              of responsibility from taking such additional action as may be
              necessary to conform with any standard of conduct or comply with
              any duty imposed by the Esquimalt Graving Dock Regulations and
              the Best Practices of the Esquimalt Graving Dock or otherwise by
              applicable international, national, provincial and local laws.<strong></strong></p>
            <p><strong>1.5 Acknowledgement by Businesses. </strong>One senior
              authorized officer of each respective business will acknowledge,
              in writing, to the Manager, Esquimalt Graving Dock that:<strong></strong></p>
            <p>(a) they have read and understood this Code; and</p>
            <p>(b) in the case of each on-site user, compliance with this Code
              is a condition of renewing an existing on-site lease or entering
              into a new on-site lease.</p>
            <p><strong>1.6 Timing of Acknowledgement</strong>. The senior authorized
              officer of each respective business will deliver the acknowledgement
              described in Article 1.5 of this Code to the Manager, Esquimalt
            Graving Dock within two weeks of official receipt.<strong></strong></p>
            <p><strong>1.7 Distribution</strong>. This Code will be distributed
              to all businesses operating at the Esquimalt Graving Dock and will
              be published on the <em>www.pwgsc.gc.ca/pacific/egd</em> web
              site.</p>
            <p><strong>1.8 Code Review</strong>. This Code will be reviewed and
            amended as required.</p>
