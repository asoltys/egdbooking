MARSEC Level I

Please be advised that there are two capitol projects which will impact operations at EGD before the end of March 2008.  One is a surface drainage project for most of the North Landing wharf and the other is further electrical drive upgrades to the 150 tonne crane.  Before confirming exact timeframes for these projects, we await parts delivery dates for the electrical upgrade and the surface drain project has not been awarded as of this date.   We will advise as soon as we possibly can as to the specific dates these projects will be undertaken and if you have any questions or concerns please consult with EGD Operations Manager, David Latoski.

PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THE 150T CRANE WILL BE UNAVAILABLE TENTATIVELY FROM FEB. 22,2008 TO MARCH 31,2008.

A process is underway to implement new rates for our services.  As the rates are incorporated into the EGD Regulations, the approval process is not within our control therefore we cannot accurately predict when they will be  approved and then applied.  We will keep you informed and advised as soon as a schedule can be established.
