		<h3 id="CreateAccount">2.2 Creating a User Account</h3>
		<h4>2.2.1 Where to Start</h4>
		<p class="level_2">Go to the main EGD page: <a href="http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca/pacific/egd/index-e.html">http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca/pacific/egd/index-e.html</a> and
			click &quot;Booking&quot; in the side menu bar. Click the &quot;Booking Application&quot; link,
			then click &quot;Add new user account.&quot;  Enter your details, including:
			first name, last name, 6-10 character password and email address, all of which
			are required. The email address provided will be used for logging in and receiving
			email notification from EGD. Your password is not case-sensitive, so using uppercase
			letters is no different from using lowercase. For a more robust password, use
			both letters and numbers. </p>
		<h4>2.2.2 User Company/Companies </h4>
		<p class="level_2">On the next page, add to your profile the company or companies
			that you represent. Select your company from the drop down menu and click &quot;Add.&quot;  This
			can be repeated as many times as necessary. If the company that you represent
			is not listed, see 2.2.3. </p>
		<h4>2.2.3 Creating a Company Account </h4>
		<p class="level_2">Click the &quot;here&quot; link underneath the drop down menu
			(Figure 1) to create a company. Every field is required except &quot;Address
			2&quot; and &quot;Fax.&quot;  Clicking &quot;submit&quot; will create the company
			account and notify EGD of the new company request. The company will have to
			be approved before becoming active. </p>
		<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="../images/aide-help/entrpajout-compadd-eng.gif" alt="Figure 1: Adding a new company" /><br />
			Figure 1: Adding a new company </div>
		<h4>2.2.4 Activating a User Account </h4>
		<p class="level_2">Once your companies have been added, click &quot;Submit New
			User Request.&quot;  This submits your account request, and notifies EGD administration.
			Your account must be approved before becoming active. If you added multiple
			companies to your profile, they do not all need approval to activate your account.
			You will receive email notification when a user-company association is approved
			or rejected. </p>
		<p><a href="#Top">return to index</a></p>
		<h3 id="LoggingIn">2.3 Logging In</h3>
		<p class="level_1">Only one user-company association approval is required for
			account activation. Once you receive email notification that one of your user-company
			associations is approved, login using the email address and password that you
			specified creating your account. Go to <a href="http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca/pacific/egd/index-e.html">http://www.pwgsc.gc.ca/pacific/egd/index-e.html</a> and
			click on &quot;Booking&quot; in the side menu bar. Then click the &quot;Booking
			Application&quot; link. This brings you to the login page</p>
		<p> <a href="#Top">return to index</a> </p>
		<h3 id="GetPassword">2.4 Password Retrieval</h3>
		<p class="level_1">If you forget your password, click the &quot;Forgot password&quot; link
			at the login page. Enter the email address that you use to login, and your password
			will be emailed to you.</p>

		<h2 id="UsingApp">3. Using the EGD Online Booking System</h2>
		<h3 id="HomePage">3.1 Welcome Page</h3>
		<p class="level_1">Logging in presents you with the booking system &quot;Welcome
			Page.&quot;  You can access all of the booking system functionality from this
			page. All major functions are available in the menu bar beneath the page title
			(Figure 2). You can also navigate the site using the breadcrumbs (Figure 3).
			Breadcrumbs track the path you have taken through the site, so they can be used
			to navigate backwards through the pages used to get to where you currently are. </p>
		<div style="text-align:center;"> <img src="../images/aide-help/utilisateur-user-menu-eng.gif" alt="Figure 2: Menu bar" /><br />

			Figure 3: Breadcrumbs 3.1.1 Companies </div>
		<p class="level_1">The Welcome Page displays information for one company at a
			time. The name of the company whose information you are currently viewing is
			displayed in the title. If you have approval to represent more than one company,
			the current company will be displayed beneath the menu bar and additional companies
			will be listed just below this (Figure 4). You can toggle between company details
			by clicking the company names. Any companies that you are waiting to get approval
			to represent will be listed just below your company list. </p>
		<div style="text-align:center;"> <img src="../images/aide-help/entreprises-companies-eng.gif" alt="Figure 4: Your companies" /><br />
			Figure 4: Your companies 3.1.2 Bookings </div>
		<p class="level_1">All current and future bookings for the company you are currently
			viewing are displayed on the Welcome Page. For a complete listing, including
			past bookings, click the &quot;All Bookings&quot; button. Bookings are divided
			into &quot;Drydock,&quot; &quot;North Landing Wharf&quot; and &quot;South Jetty&quot; bookings.
			Only essential details are displayed: vessel name, docking dates, booking status
			and booking agent. Clicking the vessel name links you to further booking details,
			and options for editing and canceling bookings. For drydock bookings there is
			also a link to &quot;View Tariff Form&quot; or &quot;Edit Tariff Form.&quot;  Please
			see 3.6.1 for further information on tariff forms. </p>
		<p><a href="#Top">return to index</a> </p>
		<h3 id="EditProfile">3.2 Editing User Profile</h3>
		<p class="level_1">To edit your profile, click &quot;Edit Profile&quot; in the
			menu bar. The &quot;Edit Profile&quot; page is divided into three sections with
			individual submit buttons for each section. 3.2.1 Editing Personal Information </p>
		<p class="level_1">The first section is for editing your first and last names.
			Your email address cannot be edited as it is your login ID. In order to use
			a different email address, you must create a new user account. </p>

			Figure 5: Editing your name 3.2.2 Editing Your Password </div>
		<p class="level_1">The third section is for changing your password, which must
			be 6-10 characters long. Your password is not case-sensitive, so using uppercase
			letters is no different than using lowercase. For a more robust password, use
			both letters and numbers. Increase the security of your account by frequently
			changing your password.</p>

		<p><a href="#Top">return to index</a> </p>
		<h3 id="Vessels">3.3 Vessels</h3>
		<p class="level_1">A company's vessels are listed on the Welcome Page under &quot;Vessel(s).&quot; If
			the vessel you are looking for is not listed, check to make sure that you are
			viewing the details for the correct company. To view vessel details, click the
			vessel name. 3.3.1 Adding Vessels </p>
		<p class="level_1">Click &quot;Add Vessel&quot; under the company vessel list.
			All fields are required. Length and width are in metres, and block setup and
			teardown times are in days. Block setup time is the number of days required
			to set up the support blocks before the water can be drained from the dock,
			and block teardown time is the number of days needed to reverse the process.
			These must be included in the number of days requested for a booking. If a vessel
			is anonymous, any bookings for this vessel will be anonymous in the calendars
			and booking summaries. Therefore, only the dates of the booking and the status
			are displayed while the booking is pending or tentative. Upon confirmation,
			the following additional information is released: the company, vessel name and
			length, sections booked and booking time. Any other information about the vessel
			or booking is withheld from other companies' users. EGD administrators have
			access to all booking and vessel information regardless of anonymity. 3.3.2
			Editing Vessels </p>
		<p class="level_1">Click the vessel name under &quot;Vessel(s),&quot; then click
			the &quot;Edit Vessel&quot; button. You can edit any vessel details except the
			company, provided the vessel does not have any confirmed bookings. If it does,
			you will not be able to edit the vessel dimensions. To do so, you must contact
			EGD administration. Administration will be notified when vessel details are
			edited.</p>
		<h4>3.3.3 Deleting Vessels</h4>
		<p class="level_2">Click the vessel name under &quot;Vessel(s),&quot; then click
			the &quot;Delete Vessel&quot; button. Vessels can only be deleted if there aren't
			any booking requests for them. If there are, you will receive a message displaying
			the bookings for that vessel which need to be canceled before the vessel can
			be deleted. If you can delete the vessel, you will receive a confirmation page
			for deletion.</p>
		<p><a href="#Top">return to index</a> </p>
		<h3 id="Bookings">3.4 Bookings</h3>
		<h4>3.4.1 Requesting Drydock Bookings </h4>
		<p class="level_2">Click &quot;Request New Booking&quot; under &quot;Your current
			bookings...&quot; or &quot;Request Booking&quot; in the menu bar, and then select
			the drydock booking option. There are two ways to request a drydock booking,
			using specific dates or requesting the next available slot within a given date
			range for a specified number of days (i.e. Request the next available 10 day
			booking within the next year.). </p>
		<h5 class="level_2"><span class="style12">3.4.1.1 Requesting with Specific Dates</span> </h5>
		<p class="level_3"> All fields are required for booking requests. The company
			and vessel must be selected using the drop down menus, and the start and end
			dates for the booking must be specified. You can manually enter the dates in
			the &quot;mm/dd/yyyy&quot; format or use the calendar buttons. By clicking one
			of the calendar buttons, a small calendar will pop up and you can click the
			desired date. This date will be entered into the associated date box. When selecting
			docking dates, be sure to consider the amount of time needed for block setup
			and teardown. (Note: Docking dates are inclusive, i.e. a three day booking is
			denoted as May 1 to May 3.) Upon submitting a request, if the drydock is available
			for booking, your request will be submitted. If there is not an open slot for
			the specified dates, you have the option of trying a different date range, or
			continuing with the request in case a cancellation is made, and the slot becomes
			available. Please see 3.4.6 for details on the 24 hour notification process
			for cancellations. Once you submit a booking, email notification is sent to
			EGD administration and you are presented with the Tariff of Dock Charges. This
			is an optional form; for more information see 3.6.1. It is the responsibility
			of EGD administration to approve the booking; however, once you have received
			email notification of approval, you must send in the appropriate forms - Schedule
			1 and the Indemnification Clause - and the $3,500.00 booking fee before the
			booking can be confirmed. Please refer to section 3.6 for more information on
			the required forms. If your booking is approved and there are other tentative
			bookings competing for the same time slot, the 24 hour notice policy will be
			followed (Section 3.4.6). You will be notified via email if your booking is
			confirmed. </p>
		<h5 class="level_2"><span class="style12">3.4.1.2 Requesting Next Available Slot</span> </h5>
		<p class="level_3"> All fields are required, so the company and vessel must be
			selected using the drop down menus, a date range must be specified in the same
			manner as described in 3.4.1.1, and the number of days required for the booking
			must be specified. The number of days for the booking must be less than or equal
			to the length of the given date range. Upon submitting a request, you will be
			given the next available date range for the booking length specified. If this
			is acceptable, you can request the booking; if not, you can try a different
			date range. (Note: If you use the alternate requesting method, which takes specific
			dates, even if that date range is unavailable, if your booking is approved you
			will be added to a wait list in case a cancellation is made, and the 24 hour
			notification policy will be followed. Please refer to 3.4.6 for more information.
			The method of requesting the next available slot does not provide this option.)
			Once you submit a booking, email notification is sent to EGD administration
			and you are presented with the Tariff of Dock Charges. This is an optional form;
			for more information see 3.6.1. It is the responsibility of EGD administration
			to approve the booking; however, once you have received email notification of
			approval, you must send in the appropriate forms - Schedule 1 and the Indemnification
			Clause - and the $3,500.00 booking fee before the booking can be confirmed.
			Please see section 3.6 for more information on the required forms. If your booking
			is approved and there are other tentative bookings competing for the same time
			slot, the 24 hour notice policy will be followed (Section 3.4.6). You will be
			notified via email if your booking is confirmed.. 3.4.2 Requesting Jetty Bookings </p>
		<h4 class="level_3">3.4.2 Requesting Jetty Bookings </h4>
		<p class="level_2">Click &quot;Request New Booking&quot; under &quot;Your current
			bookings...&quot; or &quot;Request Booking&quot; in the menu bar, and select
			the jetty booking option. All fields are required for jetty bookings. The company,
			vessel and jetty can be selected using the drop down menus. The start and end
			dates can be specified in the same manner as described in 3.4.1.1. Upon submitting
			a request, EGD administration will be notified. To have the booking confirmed,
			you must send in the required Schedule 1 and Indemnification forms. Please refer
			to 3.6 for more information on required forms. You will be notified via email
			if your booking is confirmed. There is no fee for jetty bookings, but if the
			vessel does not arrive for the booked time, the company will be charged a booking
			fee.</p>
		<h4 class="level_2">3.4.3 Editing Bookings </h4>
		<p class="level_2">Bookings cannot be edited online. If you wish to amend a booking,
			you must contact EGD administration and mail or fax a hard copy of the Tentative
			Vessel and Change Booking Form. A <acronym title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym> version
			of this form is available online. Go to the Welcome Page and click &quot;Booking
			Forms&quot; at the top of your booking listings.</p>
		<h4 class="level_2">3.4.4 Cancelling Bookings </h4>
		<p class="level_2">Future and current bookings can be canceled. To cancel bookings,
			click the vessel name in the booking listing on either the Welcome Page or Bookings
			Archive page, then click the &quot;Request Cancellation&quot; button. By requesting
			a cancellation, EGD administration will be notified of the request and your
			cancellation will be considered pending until you receive further notificaiton.
			If you do not receive notification of your booking being canceled, the booking
			will go ahead as scheduled.</p>
		<h4 class="level_2">3.4.5 Administrative Cancellations and Deletions</h4>
		<p class="level_2">EGD administration has the ability to cancel current or future
			bookings, as well as delete past bookings. You will be notified via email if
			one of your bookings has been canceled. If administration deletes a past booking,
			you will not be notified, but you will notice that it is no longer listed in
			your archived bookings. 3.4.6 24 Hour Notice </p>
		<h4 class="level_2">3.4.6 Twenty-Four Hour Notice </h4>
		<p class="level_2">EGD has a 24 hour notice policy regarding wait lists. If there
			are multiple tentative bookings competing for a particular time slot in the
			drydock, the policy runs on a first come, first served basis. Therefore, the
			first company to have requested this time is entitled to the position provided
			they pay the booking fee and submit the required forms. However, if another
			company further down on the wait list offers the booking fee and forms first,
			all companies with tentative bookings requested before this one are given 24
			hours notice to pay the booking fee, starting from the top of the list. The
			company highest on the list will be notified first, if they choose to decline
			the time slot, the next company will be notified, and so on. If none of these
			companies offers the booking fee within their allotted time, the original company
			making the confirmation request receives the time slot. The same policy is applied
			when time slots are made available due to cancellations. </p>
		<p><a href="#Top">return to index</a> </p>
		<h3 id="Overviews">3.5 Booking Overviews</h3>
		<h4>3.5.1 Calendars</h4>
		<p class="level_2">The drydock and jetty calendars are accessible through the
			top menu bar. One month and three month views are available (Figure 8). They
			default to the current month, but any month can be viewed using the drop down
			menus. Each day displays a summary of the confirmed bookings for each section
			or jetty, as well as how many pending and tentative bookings there are for that
			day. By clicking on a date, you can view a more detailed summary of the bookings
			for that day. If a vessel is anonymous and the booking unconfirmed, it will
			be listed as &quot;Deepsea Vessel&quot; with only the status and docking dates
			available. Once confirmed, a limited amount of additional information becomes
			available. For publicly viewable vessels, there is a link to even further details
			about the booking and vessel. 3.5.2 Bookings Summary </p>
		<p class="level_2">Accessible from any of the calendar pages, there is a &quot;bookings
			summary&quot; link just under the top menu bar (Figure 8). The bookings summary
			is a table version of the information provided in the calendars. It displays
			the vessel name and length, booking status, section(s) or jetty, docking dates
			and the date the booking was requested. There is a printer friendly version
			available by clicking the &quot;View Printable Version&quot; button. </p>

		<h3 id="Forms">3.6 Booking Forms</h3>
		<h4>3.6.1 Tariff of Dock Charges </h4>
		<p class="level_2">The tariff form is an optional form that allows you to specify
			the services and facilities that will be required, allowing EGD to have sufficient
			resources available during your booking. Once your booking is confirmed, you
			should confirm your exact needs directly with EGD. You are presented with the
			form after requesting a booking. You can fill it out then, or opt to do so later.
			If you wish to edit or fill the form out later, you can do so from the Welcome
			Page. Tariff forms can be edited for pending and tentative bookings. Click the &quot;Edit
			Tariff Form&quot; link on the booking listing to make changes or to fill the
			form out for the first time. If a booking is confirmed, view the tariff form
			by clicking &quot;View Tariff Form.&quot;  Contact EGD to make changes to the
			tariff form for a confirmed booking.</p>
		<h4 class="level_2">3.6.2 Schedule 1 </h4>
		<p class="level_2">Schedule 1 provides information about the vessel and acts
			as an agreement between the booking agent and EGD. Schedule 1 must be received
			by EGD before a booking can be confirmed.</p>
		<h4 class="level_2">3.6.3 Indemnification Clause</h4>
		<p class="level_2">The Indemnification Clause is a legal disclaimer that indemnifies
			the Crown against liability for injuries or damages for the entire time the
			vessel is at EGD. It must be received by EGD before a booking can be confirmed.</p>
		<h4 class="level_2">3.6.4 Tentative Vessel and Change Booking Form </h4>
		<p class="level_2">The Tentative Vessel and Change Booking Form must be sent
			in to EGD to request a change in docking dates for a booking. </p>
