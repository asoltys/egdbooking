*******************************************************

Please be advised that when dry or wet docking requests are submitted, every attempt will be made to accommodate a specific location request.  However, if we confirm a wet or dry docking, we are only confirming that the request will be accommodated within the dry-dock or water lot.  We reserve the right to place the vessels at a location that does not interfere or impede other activity and maximizes the use of facility.  On rare occasions, a vessel may have to be repositioned during its stay and the cost of the movement will not be borne by EGD.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO AGENTS AND SHIP REPAIR FIRMS PERTAINING TO SERVICES AVAILABLE AT THE ESQUIMALT GRAVING DOCK

Commencing January 1, 2010 all users of the Esquimalt Graving Dock will be required to utilize all the services provided by the Esquimalt Graving Dock including the crane service provided by the Esquimalt Graving Dock's multiple cranes.  This includes all dry dockings and/or wet dockings where cargo and/or vessels are both being loaded and/or unloaded.  The only time that onboard cranes or other cranes will be permitted to be used are when none of the Esquimalt Graving Dock's cranes are  available for use due to operational commitments, and the use of any "other" cranes must be discussed prior to the utilization of any "other" cranes.  If any Agents and/or ship repair firms fail to utilize the Esquimalt Graving Dock's crane(s), without prior consent from the management of the Esquimalt Graving Dock, then charges will be applied at the "standby rate" which is the full main hook charge out rate per hour, during the period that the "other" cranes are being utilized.
